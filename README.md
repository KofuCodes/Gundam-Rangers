# Gundam Ranger Morpher
Gundam Ranger Morpher is a combination of two famous shows: Gundam and Power Rangers. Our project focuses on a Gundam themed Power Ranger morpher. It revolves around the wireless capability of RFID technology, which allows it to detect a chip from short distances. We created a handheld morpher that activates and lights up as soon as a card is inserted. As mentioned before, our project is themed after Gundam, so the morpher features wings inspired by the iconic designs of the Gundam robots.

# Why?
We all love power rangers and enjoyed it since we all were little. In order to mix our passions we decide to mix power rangers and our love for hardware and software. The core of power rangers were their morphers, so we all though it would be cool if we create one that does has nearly all the same capabilities that theirs had (obviously we are not transforming). After we came up with the general idea of the morpher we also felt that something was missing, like this idea was not a complete idea. We then remembered that power rangers always have a theme to them like cars, animals, dinosaur for example so we decided to theme our power rangers around gundams. We even came up with names for our power rangers.
Blue Ranger – Aegis Blue Diver
Gold Ranger – Phoenix Sin Requiem
Silver Ranger – Nebula Astray Mirage
